⏰ Alarm Clock 🔔
Welcome to the Alarm Clock, a simple yet powerful Python-based command-line application that lets you set alarms and get alerted with a sound when the time arrives! 🕒 Perfect for reminders, wake-up calls, or keeping track of tasks. 🚀

🌟 Features

🕰️ Set alarms using a 24-hour HH:MM format.
🎶 Plays a sound when the alarm goes off (with fallback to system beep).
⏳ Displays a countdown timer until the alarm triggers.
✅ Validates user input for correct time format.
🔄 Option to set multiple alarms in a single session.


🛠️ Requirements

Python 3.x 🐍
playsound library for audio playback (pip install playsound)
(Optional) An audio file (e.g., alarm.wav) for the alarm sound


📦 Installation

Clone this repository:git clone https://github.com/parsa-developer/alarm-clock.git


Navigate to the project directory:cd alarm-clock


Install the required library:pip install playsound


(Optional) Add an audio file (e.g., alarm.wav) to the project directory for a custom alarm sound.


🎯 Usage

Run the script:python alarm_clock.py


Enter the alarm time in HH:MM format (e.g., 14:30 for 2:30 PM).
Watch the countdown timer until the alarm triggers.
When the alarm goes off, a sound plays (or the system beeps if no sound file is found).
Choose to set another alarm or exit.


📸 Example
Welcome to the Alarm Clock! ⏰
Enter alarm time (HH:MM, 24-hour format): 14:30
Alarm set for 14:30 on 2025-05-02.
Time until alarm: 5 minutes 23 seconds

[When the time arrives]
🚨 Alarm! Time to wake up! 🚨
[Sound plays]
Would you like to set another alarm? (yes/no): no
Thanks for using the Alarm Clock! 😊


🔧 Notes

Sound File: The script assumes an alarm.wav file in the project directory. If missing, it falls back to the system beep. You can download a free .wav file or use your own.
Time Format: Use 24-hour format (e.g., 09:00 for 9:00 AM, 21:00 for 9:00 PM).
Next Day: If the entered time has passed for today, the alarm is set for the same time tomorrow.


🚀 Future Improvements

🎨 Add a GUI with tkinter or PyQt for a visual interface.
📱 Support multiple alarms or recurring alarms.
🔊 Allow users to choose custom sound files via input.
📅 Add date selection for alarms in the future.
🔔 Integrate desktop notifications for better alerts.
